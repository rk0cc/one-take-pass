# One Take Pass

A source code of my final year project

## Function included

* Pair instructor and student
* Integrated chat between staff, instructor and student
* Embedded schdule
* Video resources
* Mock test (or exercise)

## What happened now?

This was created on September, 2020 when before null-safety rolled out. Thus, the package may be discontinued.
And one more thing that releasing this repositor aims reverse engineering, not build the app again.
